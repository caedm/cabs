# How often (in seconds) the agent will report to the broker. If this is too

# Make sure the scripts are executable. Arguments can be appended to each script with commas,
# like so: script1,arg1,arg2 script2 script3
# pscheck doesn't have access to the Process_Listen option. By default it will look for
