# CABS
Connection Automation/Brokerage System

##Overview
CABS is used to assign machines to remote clients. Here at CAEDM, we use it to
assign RGS blades to our students. The entire project has several parts. See
the wiki for information about how the system works. For
installation instructions, see the README files inside of the sub-directories.
